Reflections 3 - images, new app features, visual polishing, planning

adding images worked like adding text but you would pass aroung the resource id until the 
adapter applies it to the layout. the resource id is and int, btw

adding new app features always take some time to think abour because often a large amount
of code gets affected and it makes sence to find the smoothesd way to implement it
taking small steps that allow the app to run is favourable (also use placeholders)

the visual polishing took a surprising amout of time. when u program java for so long
the xml feels kind of weird. using the values resource file really makes scense

planning is a core need for any programming task. its in the nature of the activity itself
