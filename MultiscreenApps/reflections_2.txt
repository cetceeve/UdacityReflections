Reflections_2 - array, ArrayList, view recycling, ListView, ArrayAdapter, custom classes

we started out with an array that allows to store primitive data types with indexes in one variable
then we switched to an ArrayList wich can hold Objects of any kind using String objects

the ArrayList was necessary to be able to recycle views not displayed on the screen in order to save memory
we used a ListView instead of the LinearLayout together with an ArrayAdapter
the ArrayAdapter is basically serving the ListView with Views displaying data form an ArrayList

this did not work for two textviews so i created my own object for the ArrayList
with contained two Strings and methods to call them

to work with my ListView I also needed to create a custom ArrayAdapter
the Adapter put the content of my Word Objects into a costum Layout with two TextViews
and returned it to our ListView

we could apply this system to every activity which made coding very fast in the end
