Reflections_1 - intents, interfaces, onClickListeners, Listeners

I learned that Intents are not only used implicitly to call other apps
but also explicit to (normally) call Activitys inside the App

writing explicit Intents is pretty strait forward and easy to look up on google

this is not to say when it comes to Interfaces.
as far as i understood, the interface is a somewhat empty class so i can define 
what has to happen when the View.ObClickListener Class is created
therefore i @Override everything that has been in the class and write my stuff

the Listeners are the way to go to deal with User Input.
there are a lot of different Listeners that can handle all sorts of UserInput
