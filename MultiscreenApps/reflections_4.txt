Reflections 4 - MediaPlayer, AudioManager, Activity Life Cycle

I used the MediaPlayer to play Audio. In general it was easy to set up, because the documentation
about it is pretty good. 
The AudioManager was pretty much the first feature that i highly copied from the internet
and only adapted to my situation. That worked pretty good.
Android Activity Life Cycle is quite cool and also easy to handle.
I thaink it could be easy to forget including the necessary features.

The most interesting part of this lesson was, that i had to include bigger features
on my own several times. These need some thought before you start to code.
Often it effects several parts of the app and as soon as you start you cannot run
the app any more. So the concept for a new feature needs to work before crushing the hole code.
Implementing the feature in a way that allows to run the app several times in order to 
check for bugs is surprisingly because you pretty much have to simulate the half finished 
code in order to know if it is supposed to be running.
