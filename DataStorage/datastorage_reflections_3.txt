--- Content Providers in Android ---
Our App now uses a Content Provider that sits between the 
Activities and the Database

in Detail:
Activity -> ContentResolver -> ContentProvider + UriMatcher -> DbHelper -> Database
using a lot of Constants from the Contract class

the ContentProvider checks if the data from the activity is valid
the information is sent using a content URI
the UriMatcher helps to read the URI and perform the correct action

the Activities now call methods via the ContentResolver directly in the ContentProvider
