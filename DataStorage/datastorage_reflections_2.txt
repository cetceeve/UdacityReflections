--- Using Database in Android ---
What we used and how:

- ContractClass
in here I stored pretty much only final Variables that were in part accessilbe via a method inside

- DbHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper
this class is used to create and maintain the database
methods like
    .getWriteableDatabase
    .getReadableDatabase
                        can be called on this method.

- i can read from the database by calling the .query method on an
SQLite Database and storeing the result in an Cursor object
both the SQLiteDatabase and the Cursor are android frameworks

The Android Documentation page for SQLite Databases with Android is great!!!
