Reflections 2 - HTTP Requests, Stream of Data + Buffered Reader

HTTP Requests are used to communicate to servers via the Internet.
In code the HTTP Requests has several steps like. 
Preparing URL, settings for the Message sent (like pull or push request)
and connect in the end.
The server allways answers in the form of a Request Code which gives
information about the status of the connection.
If the connection was good. It sents back what we requested ("pull") as a
stream of data. This data can be read line by line via a buffered reader.
This method is very effective. We also use a string builder to build up the
string line by line and only once finished we store the StringBuilder object
into the String datatype. This safes a lot of performance.
