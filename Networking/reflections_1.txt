An API provides ways for Developers, Users or Apps to interact with a server.

with the specific API

From the USGS Server we got back GeoJSON Script.
This is the most commom form on the web to share information between
different devices. The JSON can be formatted by a JSON Formatter.

Ones we got the JSON form the server we can parse it.
that means putting the JSON Skript into an Object and
retrieving the information inside the JSON Object.
JSON stores information in a tree like structure so we basically
go down deeper into the infos just like in a file explorer.
