Reflections 3 - http networking request to webserver, background thread, using loaders,user interface

___http networking request to webserver___
the http network request is performed via a url
the url holds the address of the server and a query with further instructions for the server
a request works like this:
- connecting to the webserver
- starting an input stream
- reading the input stream (input stream reader, buffered reader)
- dealing with the input stream result in your software (e.g. JSON String)

___background thread___
it makes scense to run operations like this in an background thread, so the app still works
(reacts to user input) while loading data
the background thread should be created via an AsyncTaskLoader
the loader needs his on class where the loadInBackground Method calls everything that will be done in the background thread

___using loaders___
Loaders are a seperated instance from activitys but interact with activitys
that allows the loader to execute tasks while the activity is paused (e.g when rotating the display)
this allows for a fast, responsive user interface

___user interface___
as a rule of thumb the software should always let the user know what she is currently doing
the information given should be easy to understand and visually appealing (e.g. progress bar)
